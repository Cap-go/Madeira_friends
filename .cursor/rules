// BRUTALIST DESIGN RULES
// Black, white, and yellow color scheme
// No rounded corners

To reset the dB after added migration, do Supabase dB reset
to create a migration file, do Supabase migration new
We use tailwind v4 and daisy UI the max we can, we design bold and brutalist design with main color black and white and highlight yellow
create test for DB with supabase test new, and then run the test, you should test your RLS, and functions
To update supabase type run bun run gen:types:local after db reset

- Keep components small and focused
- Maximum 50 lines per component
- Single responsibility principle
- Explicit props with default values
- Clear naming conventions
