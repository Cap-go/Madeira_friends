// BRUTALIST DESIGN RULES
// Black, white, and yellow color scheme
// No rounded corners

To reset the db after some test, do `supabase db reset`
To test migration you created do `supabase migration up`
to create a migration file, do Supabase migration new
We use tailwind v4 and daisy UI the max we can, we design bold and brutalist design with main color black and white and highlight yellow
create test for DB with supabase test new, and then run the test, you should test your RLS, and functions
To update supabase type run bun run gen:types:local after db reset

- Keep components small and focused
